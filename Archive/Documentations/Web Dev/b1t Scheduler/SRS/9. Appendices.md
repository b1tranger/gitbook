    • Routine upload automation via spreadsheet templates.

🔄 Sustainability and Community Continuation
The b1tSched project is designed to be forked, reused, or remixed by students and developers from other departments or institutions. By keeping it lightweight and open-source, the goal is to inspire others to create their own versions with their own academic calendars and task management.

Anyone can:
    • 📆 Clone or fork the GitHub repo to host their version.
    • 📁 Modify class data, advisor lists, and task sheets to match their own setup.
    • 🌟 Link their own Google Form and Sheet for custom task tracking.
    • ✨ Contribute to the trend of student-led academic organization tools.

This approach ensures b1tSched can evolve organically through community-led versions, continuing its usefulness beyond the original scope.
