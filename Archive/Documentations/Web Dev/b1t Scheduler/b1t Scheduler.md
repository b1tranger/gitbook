<!-- Documentation of the Academic Scheduler Project for UITS -->

Managing task is literally the one thing common in every profession. And in academics, where cramming knowledge is all there is to do, the proper planning of when to cram what becomes a crucial part of the whole academic journey: Throughout School, College, and University life.

In the first semester of UITS, I used to manage tasks using Google Keep. It was working fairly well, considering even CRs would forget about specific events and tasks, and I could remind them after a quick glance through my tasks list. I was able to keep up with piling assignments, prepare for exams beforehand, and multitask my way through the whole semester - all because I had a list of tasks, constantly reminding the heck out of me.

But Google Keep had its limitations.
