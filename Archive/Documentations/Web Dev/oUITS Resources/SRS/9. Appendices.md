â€¢ Live site: [ouits-res.netlify.app](https://ouits-res.netlify.app/)

â€¢ Google Drive Folders: Linked throughout site based on semester/course.

â€¢ Developer: [b1tranger](https://github.com/b1tranger) 

â€¢ Future Plans:

    â€¢ Add Database to replace Google Drive dependency.

    â€¢ Allow student contributions through a submission section similar to https://diuqbank.com/.

Note:

The oUITS-Resources project is designed not only as a standalone solution, but also as a template and inspiration for similar initiatives in other institutions or by future contributors. The long-term goal is to foster a culture of archiving and sharing academic resources in a decentralized, student-driven way.

Anyone interested can:

    â€¢ ðŸ“¦ Fork the project on GitHub to create their own instance.

    â€¢ ðŸ”— Get a backup of the original Google Drive folders to resume where this project left off or build on it.
    
    â€¢ ðŸ”§ Modify and adapt the static site to match their own university's structure.

This approach ensures that the project remains open, flexible, and relevant â€” even if the original site is no longer actively maintained.
