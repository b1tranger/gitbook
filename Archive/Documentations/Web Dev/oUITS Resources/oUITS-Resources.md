<!-- Documentation of the Resources Archiver Project for UITS -->

As a Student of UITS, the first thing I looked for when coming to the university was academic resources. And man, I had to struggle so badly just to get info on the courses (Course Outlines). Thankfully, Jobair Ahammed Sir provided some outlines for me to look at (may Allah bless that guy). Seeing the reference books' lists gave me the vague idea of acquiring them beforehand, just so I wouldn't have to do it when the classes would finally start.

Moving along, I created Google Drive folders for keeping files of all 8 semesters of the CSE department. It was initially kept private, and I would share them by getting and adding Emails one by one. I used to operate my then "pseudo-archiving" project in Google Chat. That approach did not last long due to the students lacking proper know-how and basic interest in the whole thing. It was probably this idea that "this project could help more students" if made public, that eventually led this pseudo-project to the next stage.

2nd Semester. We got the course "Web Application Design", and in the 2nd Lab (I couldn't do the first) the faculties taught us about Anchor Tags in HTML. And believe me when I say this:

it was REVOLUTIONARY.

The simple idea that you can make websites using just Anchor Tags and maybe add Google Drive links to your website felt like a small enlightenment in the context of my project. I remembered that there were some websites with the suffix "...github.io" in their URLs and figured that they were somehow related to GitHub. Then maybe GitHub could be used to make my websites online? And maybe I could get access to my files from any device without sharing my credentials?

I went to the library that day to figure out GitHub's then-yet-to-be-discovered power to "make your websites online". Just then, a guy, unsociable to most, sat beside me and stared at my face. He asked me to guess his name. I couldn't.

It was Md. Azhar Uddin Abeer - one of the more capable senior students that I know of. I only met him once and forgot about him just like that. Being a proud unsocial guy myself, I ignored that fact and took notice of the Laptop he brought along instead. I thought I could ask him about GitHub as I saw him working on his projects. And I did ask him about it. But he wasn't sure whether it could make my proud project "go online".

Instead, he let me know of "a better" option that he knew of and took me to Netlify. I made up my mind to explore GitHub later and asked him to show me the process of "making it online". Finally, after connecting with my GitHub account he named the project: "ouits-res"; which in turn created:

https://ouits-res.netlify.app/ - the most memorable URL to me for a long time since then.
